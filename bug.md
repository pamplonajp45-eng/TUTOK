I tried adding pause feature that will pause the game permanently it has this TRAINING PAUSED form
where there are button choices like, resume training, settings and abandon training. 

--When the the training was resumed it has this kind of bug that i can't control the cursor properly.
--The circles are multiplying faster , like it is stacking, and the accuracy grading was continuing even though the game was paused.
--when clicking esc, for the first time it will not pause the game quick, it will double the crosshair number, one is the normal crosshair and the other is the virtual cursor.
--when the settings button was click, it will go to the settings and then when changes are made it has only return to menu button.(must have a return to game options button , and then it will resume the game properly and continue what was left earlier)
--when clicking abandon training it will go back to the menu and the game will not reset, it will continue what was left earlier. and the form TRAINING PAUSED form is not closing.

-- multiple TRAINING PAUSED will make the crosshair disappear
